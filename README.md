This is my website to demonstrate my client work and apps I've created.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 


I had so much fun creating a website that would help me showcase my work for all to see. I started with the html and then spent most of the time on the css and js.


Optimizations
(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
